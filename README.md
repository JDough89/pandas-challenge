# pandas-challenge
 The goal of this weeks challenge was to analyze district-wide data to be able to make strategic decision regarding future school budgets and priorties. We were given two .csv files to analyze. From the analysis it can be seen that the charter schools have a higher percentage of students passing where as district schools have a lower overall percentage. The analysis also shows that schools with a lower per student budget actually have a higher overall passing percentage.
